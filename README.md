# LoopDetectorData
I wrote this code to analyse raw detector data collected a four sites in Muenster, Germany. The data were collected using the Zelt<sup>Evo</sup> from EcoCounter. 

The analysis are published in the following paper: 
  - Kaths, H., Roosta, A., Fischer, J., Kathmann, T., & Pusica, A. (2024). "Propagation of density across the width of a bicycle path", submitted for consideration in the Transportation Research Record
Please cite the paper if you use the code or data. 

Analyses:
We are interested in the flow characteristics of bicycle traffic and define the following parameters for the entire cross-section and each inductive loop independently.
  $\overline(q_l) = N_{l}/T$
